Here are strategies to keep customers coming back:\n\n\n\n### Loyalty Programs\n\n- Implement a points-based system rewarding purchases and engagement\n\n- Offer exclusive products or early access to loyal customers\n\n- Provide tiered benefits to encourage increased engagement\n\n- Example: \"Our 'Cannaclub' loyalty program offers points for purchases, reviews, and referrals, which can be redeemed for discounts or exclusive products\"\n\n\n\n### Referral Incentives\n\n- Encourage customers to refer friends with incentives for both parties\n\n- Make the referral process simple and trackable\n\n- Ensure referral programs comply with local regulations\n\n- Example: \"Our 'Buds for Buds' program gives both the referrer and the new customer a $20 credit on their next purchase\"\n\n\n\n### Post-Purchase Engagement\n\n- Send follow-up emails asking for product feedback\n\n- Provide care instructions or usage tips after purchase\n\n- Offer personalized product recommendations based on purchase history\n\n- Example: \"Three days after a customer purchases a new vape pen, we send an email with cleaning tips and links to compatible cartridges\"", "mimetype":

First, visitors must enter their birth date. Then, for access to purchasing, we use a third-party service to verify their ID.\"\n\n\n\n## 2.2 Advertising Limitations\n\n\n\nCannabis advertising is heavily restricted and varies by jurisdiction. Marketers must be aware of both platform-specific and location-specific regulations.\n\n\n\n### Platform-Specific Restrictions\n\n- Google: Prohibits ads for cannabis and related products\n\n- Facebook/Instagram: No promotion of cannabis sales, but some educational content allowed\n\n- Twitter: Allows some cannabis ads in jurisdictions where it's legal\n\n- LinkedIn: Generally allows B2B cannabis content but restricts consumer-facing ads\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Focus on organic social media content rather than paid ads\n\n- Use content marketing and SEO to improve visibility without paid advertising\n\n- Leverage cannabis-friendly ad networks (e.g., Mantis, Traffic Roots)\n\n\n\n### State and Local Advertising Laws\n\n- Vary widely by state and even by city\n\n- Common restrictions:\n\n  - No ads within 1000 feet of schools, parks, or youth centers\n\n  - No use of cartoons or other imagery appealing to children\n\n  - Required warnings or disclaimers on all advertisements\n\n  - Restrictions on billboard advertising\n\n\n\nExample: \"In California, all cannabis advertisements must include the licensee's license number and the phrase 'For use only by adults 21 and older. Keep out of reach of children.'\"\n\n\n\n## 2.3 Health Claims\n\n\n\nMaking health claims about cannabis products is strictly regulated by the FDA and state agencies.\n\n\n\n### FDA Guidelines on Health Claims\n\n- Cannot claim that cannabis or CBD products diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease\n\n- Medical claims must be substantiated by reliable scientific evidence\n\n- Even implied health claims can be problematic\n\n\n\n### Proper Disclaimers\n\n- All marketing materials should include appropriate disclaimers\n\n- Common disclaimers:\n\n  - \"This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\"\n\n  - \"These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.\"\n\n  - \"Results may vary.\"\n\n\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Focus on describing the effects rather than making health claims\n\n- Use customer testimonials carefully, ensuring they don't make unsubstantiated claims\n\n- Consult with legal counsel before making any claims about health benefits\n\n\n\nExample: Instead of saying \"Our CBD oil cures anxiety,\" say \"Many customers report feeling more relaxed after using our CBD oil.\"\n\n\n\n## 2.4 Packaging and Labeling\n\n\n\nPackaging and labeling requirements are designed to ensure product safety and informed consumption.\n\n\n\n### THC Content Labeling\n\n- Must clearly state THC content (usually in milligrams)\n\n- For edibles, state THC content per serving and per package\n\n- Some states require THC warning symbols on packaging\n\n\n\n### Child-Resistant Packaging\n\n- Most states require child-resistant packaging for cannabis products\n\n- Packaging must meet standards set by the Poison Prevention Packaging Act\n\n- Re-sealable packages may be required for multi-serving products\n\n\n\n### Warning Labels\n\n- Required warnings vary by state but often include:\n\n  -
