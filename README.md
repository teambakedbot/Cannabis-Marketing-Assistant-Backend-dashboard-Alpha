## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.11** or higher
- **Redis server**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate your virtual environment using the command appropriate for your operating system:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate

# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example of what to include:

```env
# .env file
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
CANNMENUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid_here
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token_here
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your_twilio_phone_number_here
```

### 5. Start Redis Server

Make sure your Redis server is running. You can start it using the following command:

```bash
redis-server
```

### 6. Run the Application

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### 7. Run Data Ingestion

If you need to run data ingestion, execute:

```bash
python app/data_ingestion.py
```

### 8. Run Dataset Migration

To migrate datasets, run:

```bash
python app/migrate_datasets.py
```

## Testing

Ensure that your Redis server is running correctly before starting the application. You can test the connection by using a Redis client or command line.
